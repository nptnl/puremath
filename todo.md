# todo list, in no particular order

***all items are tentative and might not happen ever***

- polynomial long division

- optimize exp, ln, trig and inverse trig

- define more functions for quaternions

- sqrt and/or ln objects for exact irrationals

- more functions for rationals

- 4D coordinate objects with 4D rotation! project into 3D space and then project that into 2D space -_-

- integrate quaternions with reals and comps

- heavy fractal generation optimization

- collapse lower-base numbers into base64 even more compact storage in NPXL images

- compund NPXL files into a video for real-time translation and rotation

- voxel spaces and 3D fractals
